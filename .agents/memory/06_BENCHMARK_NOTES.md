# Benchmark Notes

## Important conclusions

- `000302` improvement is attributed mainly to the new detector weight.
- `000263` IDSW regression is not caused by detector weight.
- User confirmed both old and new weights produce IDSW ≈ 6 on current code for `000263`.
- Legacy 21/06 had IDSW ≈ 2 on `000263`.
