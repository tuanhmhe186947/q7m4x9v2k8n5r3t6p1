# Project Memory Short

- Do not hardcode `000263`/`000302` as optimizer target videos anymore.
- For optimizer ranking defaults, derive weak target videos from:
  `outputs/eval/hybrid_bytetrack/Tracking mới tắt smooth/yolov8/iou0_area0_condarea0_merge0/tracking_metrics.csv`
- Current weakest set from that file is:
  - `Pigs291119_000263_30fps`
  - `Pigs291119_000226_30fps`
  - `Pigs301119_000327_30fps`
  - `Pigs301119_000328_30fps`
- For `evaluate_tracking.py` metric comparisons, use commit `b697c4eba36db280cbf01f446873da17bcac509d` as the relevant historical reference instead of legacy 21/06.
- Critical IDSW-preserving tracking flow in `src/pig_behavior/tracking/runner.py`:
  - `apply_identity_swap_guard(...)` runs only when `cfg.enable_offline_smoothing and cfg.identity_swap_guard`.
  - `refine_shapes_temporally(...)` and then `stabilize_overlap_hidden_islands(...)` run only when `cfg.enable_offline_smoothing and (cfg.smooth_boxes or cfg.refine_boxes)`.
  - Do not change this back to `cfg.enable_offline_smoothing or cfg.mode == "hybrid_bytetrack"`; that drift was identified as a likely cause of worse IDSW versus commit `b697c4eba36db280cbf01f446873da17bcac509d`.
- Current tracking CLI flow:
  - Use `scripts/track_videos.py` for batch/single-video tracking.
  - `track_videos.py` calls `python -m pig_behavior.tracking.cli`; `src/pig_behavior/tracking/cli.py` must keep its `__main__` entrypoint.
  - `track_videos.py --eval-config <name>` reuses `evaluate_tracking.py` presets and passes them to tracking CLI as `--profile-override KEY=VALUE`.
  - `track_videos.py` must pass `src` via `PYTHONPATH` to the subprocess so module execution works without editable install.
  - `--no-emit-hidden-tracks` keeps tracker-maintained/interpolated boxes in the output but writes their `Hidden` attribute as `No` for CVAT relabeling; it does not disable internal tracking/association/occlusion state.
- Current runtime variants to compare are:
  - C:\Users\ironh\Downloads\PIG_Behavior_Project\outputs\eval\hybrid_bytetrack\Tracking moi tat smooth\yolov8
  - C:\Users\ironh\Downloads\PIG_Behavior_Project\outputs\eval\hybrid_bytetrack\Tracking moi bat smooth
- In reports, no smooth is currently worse than smooth; do not assume the unsmoothed runtime is the better baseline.
- Optimizer default scopes should stay tracking-focused.
- Detector-only presets were moved to explicit `--scope detector_probe` because `overnight_iou0` showed detector-only metrics were identical to `base`.
- Continue focusing on code and runtime behavior in association.py and runner.py, not detector weight.
