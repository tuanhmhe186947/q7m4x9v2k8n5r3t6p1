# Current Decision

## 2026-07-03 tracking decision

- Treat `outputs/eval/hybrid_bytetrack/20260703_193439/smooth_det020_loose/iou0_area0_condarea0_merge0/tracking_metrics.csv` as the current best 2-video tradeoff for `000231` + `000302`.
- Result:
  - `Pigs291119_000231_30fps`: IDSW `2`, HOTA `0.9705892717094201`, IDF1 `0.9847241970177549`.
  - `Pigs291119_000302_30fps`: IDSW `0`, HOTA `0.9930104703678451`, IDF1 `0.9964355605255801`.
  - `ALL`: IDSW `2`, HOTA `0.9820366705826231`, IDF1 `0.9907038986528682`.
- Keep the current split lost-track reacquire approach:
  - `lost_track_reacquire_guard=true`.
  - `lost_track_reacquire_non_same_raw_distance_guard=false` for the current best tradeoff.
  - `lost_track_reacquire_raw_owner_guard=true`; do not turn it off globally.
  - Keep `lost_track_different_raw_hidden_owner_bypass=true`, `lost_track_different_raw_hidden_owner_min_missed=2`, and `lost_track_different_raw_hidden_owner_min_center_gain=0.03`.
- Ablation findings:
  - Turning off raw-owner guard globally gives `000302` IDSW `0` but makes `000231` much worse.
  - Turning off only non-same-raw distance guard gives `000231` IDSW `2` but still needs the hidden-owner bypass to recover `000302`.
  - Tightening only appearance threshold did not change the bad `000231=8`, `000302=0` result; owner state / center gain was the useful tightening.

## Current baseline

- Do not use legacy 21/06 as the primary comparison point anymore; when discussing `evaluate_tracking.py` metric drift, compare against commit `b697c4eba36db280cbf01f446873da17bcac509d`.
- Current accepted `hybrid_bytetrack` post-processing flow is the two-gate flow restored from `b697c4eba36db280cbf01f446873da17bcac509d`: identity guard requires `enable_offline_smoothing and identity_swap_guard`; temporal refinement plus `stabilize_overlap_hidden_islands` requires `enable_offline_smoothing and (smooth_boxes or refine_boxes)`.
- This flow is considered IDSW-critical and should be preserved unless an explicit ablation proves a replacement is better.
- Current tracking execution flow is `scripts/track_videos.py` -> `python -m pig_behavior.tracking.cli`.
- `track_videos.py --eval-config <name>` should stay aligned with `evaluate_tracking.py` named presets and forward them as `--profile-override KEY=VALUE`.
- `pig_behavior.tracking.cli` must keep the module entrypoint and `--profile-override` support; otherwise `track_videos.py --eval-config` either exits without running or fails argument parsing.
- `--no-emit-hidden-tracks` is an output-labeling control for CVAT relabeling: keep tracker-maintained/interpolated boxes, but export their `Hidden` attribute as `No`. It must not be treated as disabling internal hidden state, association, motion prediction, occlusion holding, or smoothing.
- Treat Tracking moi bat smooth as the current quality baseline when reading reports.
- Tracking moi tat smooth/yolov8 is still a relevant runtime variant, but its reported metrics are currently worse.
- For optimizer default target-video diagnostics, do not pin `000263`/`000302`.
- Instead derive the weak default target set from the current no-smooth baseline metrics file:
  `outputs/eval/hybrid_bytetrack/Tracking mới tắt smooth/yolov8/iou0_area0_condarea0_merge0/tracking_metrics.csv`
- Do not include detector-only presets (`det_conf`, `max_raw_detections`, `nms_iou` only) in the default optimizer scopes.
- Artifact `outputs/eval/hybrid_bytetrack/overnight_iou0/optimizer/tracking_optimizer_summary.csv` showed detector-only presets matched `base` metrics for both smooth and no-smooth.
- Detector-only checks now belong in explicit `--scope detector_probe` runs or explicit `--preset` runs.

## Investigation focus

- Keep focus on runtime and code-path differences inside hybrid_bytetrack.
- Primary suspects remain association.py raw_id owner/penalty/bypass logic and all_detection_indices matching.
- Secondary suspect remains forced post-processing in runner.py for hybrid_bytetrack.

## Guardrails

- Do not blame detector weight for the 000263 regression.
- Do not enable condarea by default without an explicit ablation.
- Prefer small, reversible patches.
